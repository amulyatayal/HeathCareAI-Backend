1781	What is Goserelin and how does it work?	Goserelin, marketed under the brand name Zoladex, is a medication used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It belongs to a class of drugs known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Goserelin works by initially stimulating the pituitary gland to release more luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but with continued use, it paradoxically suppresses the production of these hormones. This suppression leads to a reduction in estrogen levels in women, which can help slow or stop the growth of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells.

1941	What is DCIS and how does it differ from invasive breast cancer?	DCIS, or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, is an early form of breast cancer where abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct but have not spread outside the duct. Unlike invasive breast cancer, DCIS cells have not developed the ability to spread into surrounding breast tissue or other parts of the body.	DIAGNOSIS_TESTING	Breast Cancer	All Stages	bcc39-dcis-web.pdf	DCIS is an early form of breast cancer. Breast cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to divide and grow in an unusual and uncontrolled way. When cancer cells have developed in the ducts and stay in the ducts (in situ), it’s called DCIS.	All	2025-12-11	Healthcare AI Team		
1942	What are the common symptoms of DCIS?	DCIS usually does not present with symptoms. It is most commonly detected during routine breast screening or mammograms. In rare cases, symptoms may include a breast lump, nipple discharge, or a rash around the nipple known as Paget’s disease of the breast.

Most cases of DCIS are found during routine breast screening or if you have a mammogram (breast x-ray) for another reason.	All	2025-12-11	Healthcare AI Team		
1943	How is DCIS diagnosed?	DCIS is diagnosed through a series of tests including a mammogram, ultrasound scan, core biopsy, and sometimes a vacuum-assisted biopsy. These tests help determine the presence and grade of DCIS.	DIAGNOSIS_TESTING	Breast Cancer	All Stages	bcc39-dcis-web.pdf	DCIS is diagnosed using a range of tests. These may include: A mammogram (breast x-ray), An ultrasound scan (using sound waves to produce an image), A core biopsy of the breast and sometimes lymph nodes.	All	2025-12-11	Healthcare AI Team		
1944	What are calcifications and how are they related to DCIS?	Calcifications are tiny white dots seen on mammograms, which are spots of calcium salts. While they can be benign, they may also indicate DCIS. Further imaging and biopsies are conducted to determine if calcifications are cancerous.	DIAGNOSIS_TESTING	Breast Cancer	All Stages	bcc39-dcis-web.pdf	These white dots are spots of calcium salts called calcifications. Calcifications can sometimes be due to DCIS, but this is not always the case.	All	2025-12-11	Healthcare AI Team		
1945	What are the grades of DCIS and what do they indicate?	DCIS is graded as low, intermediate, or high based on how different the cancer cells look from normal breast cells and their growth rate. Low-grade DCIS cells look most like normal cells and grow slowly, while high-grade cells look very different and may grow quickly.	DIAGNOSIS_TESTING	Breast Cancer	All Stages	bcc39-dcis-web.pdf	DCIS is graded as: Low grade – the cancer cells look most like normal breast cells and are slower growing, Intermediate grade – the cancer cells look less like normal breast cells and are growing faster than low grade, High grade – the cancer cells look different to normal breast cells and may be fast growing.	All	2025-12-11	Healthcare AI Team		
1946	Can DCIS develop into invasive breast cancer?	If left untreated, DCIS may develop the ability to spread outside the ducts into surrounding breast tissue, becoming invasive breast cancer. However, there is no certain way to predict if this will happen.

2561	What is breast reconstruction?	Breast reconstruction is surgery to create a new breast shape after surgery to remove your whole breast (mastectomy) or part of the breast (breast-conserving surgery). The aim is to create a breast shape that looks as natural as possible and matches the breast on the other side in size, shape, and position.

2588	What are the different types of breast implants used in reconstruction?	There are two types of breast implants used in reconstruction: fixed-volume implants, which are usually filled with silicone, and tissue expander implants, which are gradually filled with saline over time to stretch the skin. The choice depends on your specific situation and the recommendations of your surgeon.	SURGERY_PROCEDURES	Breast Cancer	All Stages	bcc7-breast-reconstruction-booklet-2024-web.pdf	Types of breast implant There are 2 types of breast implant. Fixed-volume implant A fixed-volume implant has a silicone outer shell and is usually filled with silicone.

2646	What is capsular contracture and how is it treated?	Capsular contracture is a condition where the scar tissue capsule around an implant toughens and tightens, making the breast feel hard and possibly distorting its shape. It may cause pain. Treatment may involve removing the implant and capsule, possibly replacing it with another implant or discussing other reconstruction options.	LONG_TERM_CARE	Breast Cancer	All Stages	bcc7-breast-reconstruction-booklet-2024-web.pdf	After implant reconstruction, a thin layer of scar tissue builds up around the implant to form a capsule. This is part of the healing process. In most cases this capsule stays soft, but sometimes it can toughen and tighten around the implant. This can make the breast feel hard and may distort the shape of the breast. Some people also have pain. When this happens, it’s called capsular contracture.	All	2025-12-11	Healthcare AI Team

There are three types of breast pain: cyclical breast pain, which is related to a woman’s menstrual cycle; non-cyclical breast pain, which is not related to periods and can have various causes; and chest wall pain, which feels like it’s in the breast but originates elsewhere, such as from a pulled muscle or inflammation around the ribs.

For inflammation around the ribs (costochondritis or Tietze syndrome), rest, pain relief, and possibly injections of local anaesthetic and steroid may be recommended.
